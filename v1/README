# 1. srv_longlat.py: I wrote this first, since couldn't find info on ra/dec
# 2. srv_radec.py: I wrote this after "srv_longlat.py" (use python v.3.7 or lower, because of "ephem")
# 3. srv_radec_skyfield.py: Then I found skyfield, also realised that
"ephem" module that I used in "srv_radec.py" is planned to be decommissioned
